        <p>
            The length of your wavy hair texture lies between the curly and straight hair. 
            One of the accurate ways to measure your hair length is simply using a measuring tape from your forehead to the tip of your hair, where your hair length ends. 
            However, this kind of measurement helps to know your hair grows the longest and thickest.

            When you are measuring your hair length, it should be calculated from the top of your head to the bottom of your hair, as the hair is straight in line.
